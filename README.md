Use SSH and public key authentication to append a local log to a remote system log.

File based, very simple, log rotation and shipping to appended central log.

Say, for some little cloud nodes that are temporary and we want to work with text logs,
ship/rotate the logs centrally to a non-cloud analysis/backup server etc.
